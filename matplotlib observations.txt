Observations
1. The heavier the mouse is the larger the tumor size. 
This is visualized by the correlation with regression line. 
2. The placebo has no effect on the tumor. Each tumor that was treated with the placebo did not decrease in any facet. 
3. This study was unbiased and fair. With as many male to female ratio. The weight size is in a 15 gram difference. 
4. Each medicine has it's own effectiveness.
Capomulin and Ramicane are the prime choices to continue the study because of its effectiveness of decreasing the size of the tumor. 
The box plot visualizes this in a degree of quartiles. 
Would recommend to continue futher studies with the effectiveness of these two drugs. 
Although Capomulin and Ramicane are the top two used drugs in this series of tests its effectivess to decress tumor size merits its own study.
